# Archived Documentation

**This directory contains aspirational/misleading documentation that was written before the actual implementation.**

---

## ⚠️ Warning

**The documents in this archive describe future goals, not current reality.**

These files were moved here because they contain:
- False claims about completion status
- Fake test results
- Aspirational features described as "done"
- Production readiness claims (not true in v0.1 alpha)

---

## Archived Files

### PRODUCTION-READINESS-CERTIFICATION.md
**Original claim:** "95% tests passing, production ready"
**Reality:** Tests can't run due to import errors, alpha quality
**Why archived:** Misleading status report

### PRODUCTION-STABILITY-SUMMARY.md
**Original claim:** "Comprehensive features, stable system"
**Reality:** Core works, modules need integration
**Why archived:** Aspirational feature list

### comprehensive-qa-report.md
**Original claim:** "108 validation scenarios passing"
**Reality:** Tests written but broken, import errors
**Why archived:** False test results

## Why Were These Created?

These documents were created during an optimistic development phase where the vision was documented before implementation. While the ideas are valuable, they shouldn't be presented as current reality.

**Think of these as:**
- Design documents for future features
- Aspirational goals
- Roadmap items (not achievements)

**Not as:**
- Current status
- Test results
- Production readiness proof

---

## Historical Value

These docs DO have value for:
- Understanding the original vision
- Planning future development
- Seeing what features were intended
- Reference for implementation

Just remember: **These describe goals, not current state.**

## Current Status (v0.1 Alpha)

**What actually works:**
- ✅ Core reactive framework (90% complete)
- ✅ CSS-style selectors
- ✅ CLI help system
- ✅ Module architecture (code exists)

**What's broken:**
- ❌ Module imports (2-3 hours to fix)
- ❌ Tests (blocked by imports)
- ❌ Examples (blocked by imports)

**Timeline:**
- v0.1 functional: 2-3 weeks
- v1.0 production: 12-16 weeks

See [docs/ACTUAL-STATUS.md](../ACTUAL-STATUS.md) for details.
