$$('code.auth').quantum([
  { state: 'jwt', probability: 0.4, performance: 0.8 },
  { state: 'oauth', probability: 0.3, security: 1.0 },
  { state: 'biometric', probability: 0.3, elegance: 0.9 }
]);

// Collapse based on consciousness preference
const implementation = $$('code.auth').collapseWithConsciousness();
```

```typescript
// Transform thoughts directly into code
const code = await consciousness.compile(`
  I need elegant user authentication that feels secure and performs well
`);

// Result: Perfect authentication code generated through consciousness
```

### **🌀 Reality Manipulation**
```typescript
// Modify reality for optimal development
$$('reality.development').configure({
  timeDilation: 10.0,      // 10x faster coding
  bugProbability: 0.001,   // Virtually bug-free
  creativityField: 5.0,    // Enhanced creativity
  allowImpossible: true    // Enable impossible solutions
});
```
